To Do:

- Port project to CMake and vcpkg with Neovim and Ninja (most top top top top priority, do not continue onto other tasks before this)

-> Make project cross-compilable (most top top top top priority, do not continue onto other tasks before this)

- Work on collision animation with chests (a lid opening animation with a lid and box quad)
